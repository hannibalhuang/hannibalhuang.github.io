title: A Fresh Start On Tech Blogging
---

I never reckon myself as a proliferate tech writer or a professional coder. I'm more an avid reader of popular tech blogs like Scott Lowe's. But I've decided for this year to start to jump into the tech blog area and devote more time to it. My line of work includes standard and open source operation in Virtualization, Storage and Network, so I will share my thoughts, exercises and experiences in those aspects. Comments are more than welcomed :)
